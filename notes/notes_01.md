# 'satan girl' notepad/sketchbook

**ADAMANTINE**

inspired by:

- this one photo joanna and her roommates in front of the pentagram
- jen's character arc in TOAFN
- me having just read all about laveyan satanism

some ideas i've had:

- "joanna"'s (ugh i really need a different name already) high priestess
  status is only in a game, some sort of RPG (online? in person?)

- she sees a therapist, we learn about her through that and stuff.
  actually, she probably has just started seeing the therapist.

- she has a dayjob which is NOTHING like the position of power that she has
  in the cult (?)

- it's actually a cult, right?

- or her occult powers seep into her professional life and then endanger her
  career?

- within the cult, she starts out as a sort of acolyte but levels up to
  priestess?

- more drama: she's on the *cusp* of becoming a priestess but that requires
  doing some things
  
- /OR MAYBE/ she discovers the cult early on and levels up throughout the
  story

- i want a scene where she takes control of stuff IRL and it just weirds
  everyone out

- but there needs to be an awakening, too -- something that stirs her

- what is her day job anyway? something subservient or something... nobody's
  boss

- using magick to get what you want, forgetting about people who disapprove
  of you
