## Biography

Bisky was born in Triskellian to her mother, Lilac, and her father, Petrus
Damiat.  Lilac died in Bisky's youth due to somewhat mysterious reasons that
have never been quite clear to her. Petrus says that she was taken by a
great illness, but Bisky's secret research has opened her to the possibility
that she may have died from complications of a childbirth from another mate.

Overall, there are two kinds of skunks: those who have a "beatific" attitude
towards their difference from other animals, and those who are perpetually
annoyed at it. Bisky fits squarely in the latter group, but she hopes to
overcome her own loud mouth at some point. She's working on it!

She's reminded of her skunkness not just because she looks it, but also
because she's managed to fulfill several skunk stereotypes: her name is of a
nice-smelling thing, most of her friends and acquaintances are also skunks,
and so on. But recently, she has committed herself to trying to break that
mold.

She's super loyal, but you have to work hard in order to gain that loyalty
and trust from her. This mainly comes from her (slightly warped) worldview
that everyone simply doesn't like skunks. She's definitely got a "social
justice warrior" complex going on, and is sensitive to even the slightest of
remarks.

Bisky is not _bitter_ or _curmudgeony_ in that way, though. Over time, she
has found a way to channel that frustration into doing the best job
possible, albeit teetering on overachievement. She was an *excellent* and
well-behaved student, and hopes to attend university at some point.
