# other notes

other ideas i've come across for myself in the meanwhile

- jessica + aalea at the airport restaurant/bar in DEN

- incident with the chaser: bisky going down on this guy who *really* wants
  to get sprayed, --> objectification  ("you should do that exotic thing you
  do *FOR ME*")

- gardenia's life is way less complicated. mental health is basically OK and
  she's fine with hanging around other skunks mostly. (i think she might be
  bisky's "alice"). i think she's an artist. but she's got problems too.
  she's not perfect. (no one is.) i wonder what those should be.
  demonstrating Gardenia + Bisky's super friendship means they tell each
  other everything. here's an idea.  Way back in grade school, one time,
  some kid made Bisky made Gardenia laugh so hard. But Gardenia couldn't
  hold in the scent gland. was super embarrassing. Bisky is a good friend
  and took the blame for it because it was actually some event that was very
  important for Gardenia (an art show? chess competition? an athletic event?)

  yeah maybe it was like a track and field competition or something and
  Gardenia nearly gets disqualified because of it (nervousness/anxiety
  combined with laughing really hard -> can't hold it in), so Bisky takes
  the fall for her friend. big sacrifice. hmm maybe this should happen
  _within_ the story rather than making it part of the backstory. 

  track event. it's a relay?

  OR MAYBE it's not a competition at all, but instead she has a spot in the
  symphony orchestra for the first time and she gets nervous? i kinda like
  this better, i think, Gardenia is artistic/musical for sure. plays the
  violin? she has a violin solo.
